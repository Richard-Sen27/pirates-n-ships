# Playtest: the crew member on the GeckoLib rig (work package M1)

The rig file, the animation set and the working flag are covered by 11 JUnit tests and 2 GameTests. Rotation signs,
the hand-item transform and the look of the poses were derived on paper and have never been seen in game.

Setup: `./gradlew :neoforge:runClient`, a creative world, a crew member (`/summon pirates_n_ships:crew_member` or the
spawn egg), a ship with a sail winch and a bilge pump, the captain's whistle. Please send `latest.log` if anything
differs.

## Steps
1. **Idle.** Spawn one. Expected: a sailor skin (striped shirt, red bandana); the arms sway slowly; the head follows
   you; no missing-texture or missing-model errors in the log.
2. **Walking.** Let it stroll. Expected: arms and legs swing in opposite phase and the legs move forward and backward.
   If limbs bend sideways or backwards, the rotation signs are flipped: say which limb.
3. **Winch.** Assign it to the sail winch and order a hoist with the whistle. Expected: it stands at the winch (not
   sitting), switches to a hand-over-hand hauling pose leaning forward for the duration of the order, then blends
   back to idle.
4. **Pump.** The same at the bilge pump with "Man the pumps": the work pose while pumping.
5. **Seated.** Put it in a boat (lead it in or `/ride`). Expected: a sitting pose with legs forward at the vanilla
   rider height, no extra offset.
6. **Holding items.** `/item replace entity @e[type=pirates_n_ships:crew_member,limit=1] weapon.mainhand with
   minecraft:iron_sword`, then `weapon.offhand` with a torch. Expected: the sword in the right hand pointing forward
   like a player's, the torch in the left hand, both following the arms while walking and working. Report floating,
   offset or rotated items.
7. **Moving ship.** A crew member at a station while the ship sails and heels. Expected: it stays at the station,
   upright and smoothly placed, with no new jitter. Also watch an unassigned crew member standing on deck: if it runs
   in place because the deck moves, say so.
8. **Hurt and death.** The hurt flash and the death animation still show.
