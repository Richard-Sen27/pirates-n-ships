Hand-made model sources (design.md §4.8).

- `models/`: Blockbench projects (`.bbmodel`), one per model. Our own textures are embedded; vanilla textures are
  not (Mojang's assets are never committed) and load from `../vanilla/<name>.png`.
- `renders/`: a render of each model.
- `vanilla/`: ignored by git. Run `python3 tools/extract_vanilla_textures.py` once before opening a project so the
  vanilla textures show (pass block texture names, e.g. `spruce_planks`, to extract more for a new model).

Block model workflow:
1. Build the model in Blockbench (format Java Block/Item); load vanilla textures from `art/vanilla/` with namespace
   `minecraft`, folder `block`.
2. Export with `Codecs.java_block.compile()`.
3. Post-process: prefix textures with `minecraft:`, add `"parent": "minecraft:block/block"` and a `particle` texture.
4. Write it to `common/src/main/resources/assets/pirates_n_ships/models/block/<name>.json`, save the project here
   (without embedded vanilla textures), and point the block state at it in the module's datagen; run
   `./gradlew :neoforge:runData`.
5. The JUnit tests in `core/assets` (`HandMadeModelsTest`, `AssetReferencesTest`) guard the result.

Workflow notes (figurehead batch):
- `Codecs.java_block.compile()` drops the `block/` folder (`minecraft:oak_planks`) unless each texture's `folder` and
  `namespace` are set again after `fromPath(...).add()`; post-processing should add `block/` when it is missing.
- Elements outside the block (−16..32) need their position-based UVs wrapped into 0..16 per face.
- Java block rotation sign: on the x axis, −22.5 tilts the top of an element towards north (forward for a model that
  faces north) and swings its bottom towards south.
- `create_offscreen_view` plus `set_camera_angle(view: ...)` renders without moving the human's camera; the returned
  PNG lands in the session's tool-results folder and can be copied straight to `renders/`.
- A block whose model is not a full cube needs `noOcclusion()` in its properties, or neighbours cull their faces
  against it and the model renders dark.

Entity models use the Modded Entity format (Mojang mappings 1.17+); paste the body of the exported
`createBodyLayer()` into the renderer's layer method (example: `AnchorRenderer.createLayer`).
